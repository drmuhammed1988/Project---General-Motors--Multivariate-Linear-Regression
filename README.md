# Project---General-Motors--Multivariate-Linear-Regression
### Create a Multiple Linear Regression Model for General Motors (GM) Data set to predict the price
Data collected for several hundred used General Motors (GM) cars allows us to develop a multivariate regression model to determine car values based on a variety of characteristics such as mileage, make, model, cruise control, and so on.
#### Develop a Multivariate Regression Model for the data collected for several hundred used
General Motors (GM) car values based on a variety of characteristics such as:
• Price: suggested retail price for the used GM car
• Mileage: number of miles the car has been driven
• Make: manufacturer of the car such as Cadillac, Pontiac, and Chevrolet
• Cylinder: number of cylinders in the engine
• Liter: a more specific measure of engine size
• Cruise: indicator variable representing whether the car has cruise control (1 = cruise)
• Sound: indicator variable representing whether the car has upgraded speakers (1 =
upgraded)
• Leather: indicator variable representing whether the car has leather seats (1 = leather)
