# Project---General-Motors--Multivariate-Linear-Regression
### Create a Multiple Linear Regression Model for General Motors (GM) Data set to predict the price
Data collected for several hundred used General Motors (GM) cars allows us to develop a multivariate regression model to determine car values based on a variety of characteristics such as mileage, make, model, cruise control, and so on.

#### Develop a Multivariate Regression Model for the data collected for several hundred used
General Motors (GM) car values based on a variety of characteristics such as:
1. Price: suggested retail price for the used GM car
2. Mileage: number of miles the car has been driven
3. Make: manufacturer of the car such as Cadillac, Pontiac, and Chevrolet
4. Cylinder: number of cylinders in the engine
5. Liter: a more specific measure of engine size
6. Cruise: indicator variable representing whether the car has cruise control (1 = cruise)
7. Sound: indicator variable representing whether the car has upgraded speakers (1 =upgraded)
8. Leather: indicator variable representing whether the car has leather seats (1 = leather)
